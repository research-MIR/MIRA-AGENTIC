## Tiled Upscaling Feature Development Log

**Phase 1: Tiling and Captioning Pipeline Setup**

*   **Objective:** Create the initial infrastructure for breaking an image into tiles and generating a descriptive prompt for each tile.
*   **Actions Taken (2024-07-26 - 2024-07-29):**
    *   Initial infrastructure created, including database tables (`mira_agent_tiled_upscale_jobs`, `mira_agent_tiled_upscale_tiles`), orchestrator and worker functions, a watchdog, and a frontend visualizer.
    *   Addressed initial setup bugs related to storage bucket creation and Supabase Realtime configuration.
*   **Actions Taken (2024-07-30):**
    *   **Refactor & Implementation:** Implemented the full pre-processing and analysis pipeline to mimic the ComfyUI workflow.
        *   Created a new, comprehensive worker: `MIRA-AGENT-worker-tiling-and-analysis`.
        *   Deleted the original, simpler `MIRA-AGENT-worker-tiling` function.
*   **Actions Taken (2024-07-31 - 2024-08-03):**
    *   **Performance & Bug Fix Iteration:**
        1.  **Initial Problem:** The first implementation of the tiling worker was memory-intensive, leading to `Memory limit exceeded` errors.
        2.  **Refactor 1 (Memory Efficiency):** Re-implemented the worker with a more memory-efficient design using a concurrent worker pool, on-the-fly tile processing, and batched database inserts.
        3.  **Bug 1 (`TypeError`):** The refactored code introduced a `TypeError: tile.blit is not a function`. This was fixed by replacing `.blit()` with the correct `.composite()` method from the `imagescript` library.
        4.  **Bug 2 (Silent Failure):** After fixing the `TypeError`, logs showed that the `MIRA-AGENT-worker-tile-analyzer` was not being invoked, causing `generated_prompt` to be `null`. This was fixed by adding more robust error handling and logging to both the calling and receiving functions.
        5.  **Bug 3 (JSON Parsing Error):** With the analyzer now running, user-provided logs clearly showed the root cause of the `null` prompts: the analyzer was returning a JSON *string* with a `text/plain` content type, not a JSON object. The main worker was attempting to access `data.prompt` on a string, which correctly resulted in `undefined`.
        6.  **Final Backend Fix & Hardening:**
            *   **Analyzer Fix:** The `MIRA-AGENT-worker-tile-analyzer` was corrected to return a proper `Response.json()` object with the correct `Content-Type: application/json` header.
            *   **Caller Hardening:** The `MIRA-AGENT-worker-tiling-and-analysis` function was made more defensive, with logic to parse the response even if it's a string.
            *   **Idempotency:** A unique index was added to `mira_agent_tiled_upscale_tiles` on `(parent_job_id, tile_index)`, and the database write was changed to an `upsert` to prevent data duplication from accidental re-runs.
        7.  **Bug 4 (Frontend Realtime Failure):** After all backend issues were resolved, the frontend visualizer still did not display the tiles. The initial diagnosis that the table was not enabled for Realtime was proven incorrect by a database error. The actual issue was that the `UpscaleTilingVisualizer.tsx` component was not subscribed to the Supabase Realtime channel for the `mira_agent_tiled_upscale_tiles` table. This was fixed by adding the appropriate `useEffect` hook to establish the subscription.
    *   **Initial Status:** The tiling and analysis pipeline was considered stable, but with a flawed tiling strategy.

**Phase 2: Core Tiling Logic Overhaul & Refinement**

*   **Objective:** Refactor the backend tiling mechanism to eliminate padding on edge tiles and align with more sophisticated, professional-grade workflows.
*   **Actions Taken (2024-08-04):**
    1.  **Problem Identification:** Following the initial stabilization, the user correctly identified a significant issue with the tiling strategy: the use of blank padding on edge tiles. Concerns were raised that this padding could confuse the upscaling AI and lead to incorrect final image dimensions.
    2.  **Strategic Shift:** Based on user feedback and analysis of ComfyUI's tiling behavior, the decision was made to abandon the "Fixed Grid with Padding" method in favor of a more advanced **"Variable Overlap"** (or "Justified Tiling") strategy.
    3.  **Backend Refactor:** The `MIRA-AGENT-worker-tiling-and-analysis` function was fundamentally updated.
        *   The logic for calculating tile coordinates (`x`, `y`) is now dynamic.
        *   For the final tile in each row and column, the starting coordinate is calculated to be flush with the source image's edge.
        *   This change ensures every 1024x1024 tile is filled **exclusively with real image data**, creating a larger, variable overlap on the edge tiles instead of adding blank padding.
    4.  **Data Verification:** Confirmed that the `coordinates` field being saved for each tile correctly stores the precise top-left corner of the slice. This data is sufficient for the future compositing worker to accurately reconstruct the image, correctly handling both standard and variable overlaps.
*   **Current Status:** The backend tiling logic is now significantly more robust and aligns with the user's requirements for a padding-free workflow. The pipeline is ready for the implementation of the tile generation and final compositing stages.
