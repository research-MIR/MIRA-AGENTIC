## Tiled Upscaling Feature Development Log

**Phase 1: Tiling and Captioning Pipeline Setup**

*   **Objective:** Create the initial infrastructure for breaking an image into tiles and generating a descriptive prompt for each tile.
*   **Actions Taken (2024-07-26 - 2024-07-29):**
    *   Initial infrastructure created, including database tables (`mira_agent_tiled_upscale_jobs`, `mira_agent_tiled_upscale_tiles`), orchestrator and worker functions, a watchdog, and a frontend visualizer.
    *   Addressed initial setup bugs related to storage bucket creation and Supabase Realtime configuration.
*   **Actions Taken (2024-07-30):**
    *   **Refactor & Implementation:** Implemented the full pre-processing and analysis pipeline to mimic the ComfyUI workflow.
        *   Created a new, comprehensive worker: `MIRA-AGENT-worker-tiling-and-analysis`.
        *   Deleted the original, simpler `MIRA-AGENT-worker-tiling` function.
*   **Actions Taken (2024-07-31 - 2024-08-02):**
    *   **Performance & Bug Fix Iteration:**
        1.  **Initial Problem:** The first implementation of the tiling worker was memory-intensive, leading to `Memory limit exceeded` errors.
        2.  **Refactor 1 (Memory Efficiency):** Re-implemented the worker with a more memory-efficient design using a concurrent worker pool, on-the-fly tile processing, and batched database inserts.
        3.  **Bug 1 (`TypeError`):** The refactored code introduced a `TypeError: tile.blit is not a function`. This was fixed by replacing `.blit()` with the correct `.composite()` method from the `imagescript` library.
        4.  **Bug 2 (Silent Failure):** After fixing the `TypeError`, logs showed that the `MIRA-AGENT-worker-tile-analyzer` was not being invoked, causing `generated_prompt` to be `null`. This was fixed by adding more robust error handling and logging to both the calling and receiving functions.
        5.  **Bug 3 (Assignment Error):** With the analyzer now running correctly, logs revealed a final bug: the returned prompt text was not being correctly assigned to the database record in the main worker. This has now been fixed.
*   **Actions Taken (2024-08-03):**
    *   **Final Fix & Hardening:**
        *   **Root Cause Identified:** User analysis of logs revealed the core issue: the analyzer function was returning a JSON *string* instead of a JSON *object* with the correct content-type. The calling function was therefore unable to parse `data.prompt`.
        *   **Analyzer Fix:** The `MIRA-AGENT-worker-tile-analyzer` has been corrected to return a proper `Response.json()` object.
        *   **Caller Hardening:** The `MIRA-AGENT-worker-tiling-and-analysis` function has been made more defensive, with logic to parse the response even if it's a string.
        *   **Idempotency:** A unique index has been added to `mira_agent_tiled_upscale_tiles` on `(parent_job_id, tile_index)`, and the database write has been changed to an `upsert` to prevent data duplication from accidental re-runs. The pipeline is now considered robust.
