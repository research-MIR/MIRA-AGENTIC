## Tiled Upscaling Feature Development Log

**Phase 1: Tiling and Captioning Pipeline Setup**

*   **Objective:** Create the initial infrastructure for breaking an image into tiles and generating a descriptive prompt for each tile.
*   **Actions Taken (2024-07-26):**
    *   Created two new database tables:
        *   `mira_agent_tiled_upscale_jobs`: To act as the master record for each upscale task.
        *   `mira_agent_tiled_upscale_tiles`: To track the state of each individual tile.
    *   Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) on both tables to ensure users can only access their own jobs.
    *   Created the main entry point function: `MIRA-AGENT-orchestrator-tiled-upscale`. This function creates the parent job record and delegates the tiling process.
    *   Created the first worker: `MIRA-AGENT-worker-tiling`. This function downloads the source image, slices it into tiles, creates the individual tile records in the database, and uploads the tile images to storage.
    *   Created the analysis worker: `MIRA-AGENT-worker-tile-analyzer`. This function is responsible for taking a single tile, generating a text description for it using an AI model, and saving that description back to the tile's record.
    *   Created a dedicated watchdog: `MIRA-AGENT-watchdog-tiled-upscale`. This function will periodically find tiles that are ready for analysis and trigger the analysis worker, ensuring the process is scalable and resilient.
*   **Actions Taken (2024-07-27):**
    *   Created a new developer tool page: `UpscaleTilingVisualizer.tsx`. This page allows for testing and visualizing the entire tiling and captioning pipeline.
    *   Added a link to the new tool on the main Developer page.
    *   Set up a cron job to run the `MIRA-AGENT-watchdog-tiled-upscale` function every minute, ensuring that pending tiles are automatically picked up for analysis.
